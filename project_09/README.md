## Introduction 
Introduction: The OilyGiant Mining company is looking to optimize its profits by determining the best place for a new well. In order to determine the best location for a new well a preditive model will be devised. Data will be provided for 3 regions. An analysis of potential profits and risk will be determined by using the Bootstrap technique. In order to accomplish this analysis the following steps will be taken:

Data will be collected and proepared.
A predictive model will be developed using linear regression to estimate reserve voolumes for potential new wells.
An examination of the wells with the highest predicted reseve volumes to obtimize seleciton.
An analysis of each regions profitibilities with consideration given to budget and revenue potential based on selected possible well locations.
Bootstrap techniques will be used to determine potential profits and risks to ensure the optimal location is choosen.

Purpose: The aim of this project will be to answer the following questions: 
1. Which regions will have the most profitable wells? 
2. Which oil wells will be the most profitable?
3. Which model will best predict the volume of reserves in the new wells? 

## Data 
id - unique well identifier 
f0- specific feature
f1- specific feature
f2- specific feature
product- volume of reserves in the oil well 

## Libraries Used 
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
