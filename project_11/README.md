## Introduction 
The Sure Tomorrow insurance firm seeks to address multiple challenges concerning customer insurance benefits. This initiative focuses on utilizing machine learning models to tackle these challenges while ensuring the confidentiality of customer information.

Purpose:The aim of this project will be to do the following: 
1.Customer Similarity: Identify customers similar to a specific individual to enhance marketing strategies.
2.Benefit Prediction: Assess whether a new customer is likely to receive insurance benefits, comparing a prediction model against a basic dummy model for effectiveness.
3.Benefit Quantity Prediction: Use linear regression to estimate the number of benefits a new customer might receive.
4.Data Protection: Develop a data transformation algorithm to mask personal information, ensuring client data remains secure while maintaining the effectiveness of the machine learning models. The goal is to demonstrate the algorithm's correctness without necessarily selecting the optimal model.

## Data:
Features: insured person's gender, age, salary, and number of family members.
Target: number of insurance benefits received by an insured person over the last five years.

## Libraries Used 
Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Math, Seaborn, IPython
